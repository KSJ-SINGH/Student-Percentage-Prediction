<h1 align="center">Student Percentage Prediction</h1>

## Description:

<h3 align = 'center'><i>"If you want excellent scores, you need to study more."</i></h3>

I always took this saying with a grain of salt. With the help of this project, I aim to end my skepticism regarding this proverb. Now you must be thinking, *How am I going to achieve that?* I cannot just sit down and study , that's because of two main reasons. 
1. It would be time-consuming.
2. I'm not in school anymore. (This one felt like a dealbreaker)
   
Don't worry at all dear reader, I have a plan. I am going to use a dataset which has data of marks obtained by a student and number of hours he/she studied. These attributes would become the two columns of the dataset.
Using this dataset, I could perform a simple liner regression test in order to find out whether the correlation between the two columns is positive or negative. Positive Correlation indicates that two variables that tend to move in the same direction and vice-versa.
## Prerequisites:
In order to perform the intended test, we'll require the below mentioned libraries
   1. Pandas
   2. Numpy
   3. Plotly
   4. Matplotlib
   5. Scikit-learn
   6. Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have these libraries installed in your machine, Kindly run one of the below mentioned command.

```bash
# if you use pip Packager
pip install pandas numpy plotly matplotlib notebook scikit-learn
```
```bash
# If you are using conda Packager
conda install pandas numpy plotly matplotlib notebook scikit-learn
```
