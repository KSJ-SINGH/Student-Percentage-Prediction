<h1 align="center">Student Percentage Prediction</h1>
## Description:
<h3 align = 'center'><i>"If you want excellent scores, you need to study more."</i></h3>

I always took this saying with a grain of salt. With the help of this project, I aim to end my skepticism regarding this proverb. With the help of an unsupervised ML algorithim, I am going to calculate the correlation by a linear regression test between hours studied and precentage scored by a student.
>Correlation is a statistical term describing the degree to which two variables move in coordination with one another. If the two variables move in the same direction, then those variables are said to have a positive correlation. If they move in opposite directions, then they have a negative correlation.
## Prerequisites:
In order to perform the intended test, we'll require the below mentioned libraries
   1. Pandas
   2. Numpy
   3. Plotly
   4. Matplotlib
   5. Scikit-learn
   6. Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have these libraries installed in your machine, Kindly run one of the below mentioned command.

```bash
# if you use pip Packager
pip install pandas numpy plotly matplotlib notebook scikit-learn
```
```bash
# If you are using conda Packager
conda install pandas numpy plotly matplotlib notebook scikit-learn
```
